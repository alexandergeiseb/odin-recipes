    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This baked sweet and sour chicken made with chicken thighs and pineapple
      is a "dump" version of one of the most popular dishes in a Chinese
      restaurant. Skip the deep frying and bake everything together in one dish
      to create a lighter twist on a classic with no sacrifice of flavor.
